# Space Shoot SDL_Bgi V2.

A simple space shooter demo based upon SDL_Bgi.  

This is a remake of the V1 shooter game using the library SDL_Bgi.  
I have made every effort toward staying with what is provided within the SDL_Bgi API without using any of the underlaying SDL2 functions.  

Much of the game logic has been tidied up in this version.  
I have included a basic FPS control as well as a demonstration intro and outro to the game.  

You will need [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) development version, [SDL_Bgi V3](https://sdl-bgi.sourceforge.io/) as wel as [WavBeep02.zip](https://encode.su/threads/383-A-command-line-tool-for-Windows-which-beeps-through-the-System-Speaker).  
Please read my booklet ["A Beginners Guide To SDL_bgi.pdf"](https://github.com/Axle-Ozz-i-sofT/A-BEGINNERS-GUIDE-TO-PROGRAMMING/tree/main/Supplimental/A%20Beginners_Guide_To_SDL_bgi) for how to set up the library as well as setting up the project in Dev-C++ and Code::Blocks.

At the moment I have only done some C language demos but I am looking at creating some SDL_Bgi demos in both FreeBASIC and Python3 as well.
